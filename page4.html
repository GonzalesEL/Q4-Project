        <h1 class="text-light roboto-bold">Life of Van Gogh</h1>
        <br>
        <p class="text-light">Vincent Van Gogh was born on March 30, 1853, in Groot Zundert, North Brabant, Netherlands. From childhood, he showed signs of a moody and agitated temperament that would torment his projects throughout his entire life. Son of a Protestant pastor, he first chose to orient his life towards Protestantism, becoming a preacher in London, a student of theology and an evangelizer among the mining populations of Borinage. Becoming sympathetic to the miners’ struggle, Van Gogh practiced painting, leaving us the first traces of a somber style; one certainly marked by the misery of the miners, but one to which he also attached a sense of urgency and intensity.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="text-light">In 1886, he moved to Paris and lived with his brother Theo, who ran a small gallery of paintings. He quickly became acquainted with the young painters of the era, who were at the forefront of the most innovative artistic movements. Influenced by the work of the impressionists, as well as Japanese artists, Van Gogh’s style began to evolve. His colours brightened and his brushstrokes refined according to the shapes of the objects he represented. Beginning in 1888, he adopted the frank and bright hues present in the paintings of his French contemporaries before leaving Paris for the South of France.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="text-light">Under the sun of Provence, he painted landscapes and scenes of southern life. The artist, then based in Arles, began using curved and swirling brushstrokes, as well as pure colours, particularly yellow, green and blue. This technique, very specific to Van Gogh’s work, appears in his famous paintings Bedroom in Arles (1888) and The Starry Night (1889). Any visible creation by Van Gogh from this period, whether painted or drawn, is seemingly bestowed with a physical and spiritual vitality. In this spirit of enthusiasm, he persuaded Paul Gauguin, an artist whom he had met in Paris, to come stay with him.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="text-light">After less than two months of working together, their relationship deteriorated rapidly, culminating in the famous dispute in which Van Gogh threatened Gaugin with a razor blade. That same night, Van Gogh completely severed his own ear. A few months later, he voluntarily entered the asylum of Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, where he painted fiercely. A great number of his masterpieces were created during this period.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="text-light">In May 1890, the artist left the south and returned to his brother Theo in Paris. He took up residence close by in Auvers-sur-Oise, near the house of Dr. Gachet, an admirer and patron of several impressionist painters, as well as the subject of one of his portraits. The artist worked arduously in Auvers before passing away on July 29, 1890, leaving behind an artistic legacy that is today recognized around the globe.</p>

The <em>Starry Night</em> depicts Van Gogh's view from the asylum over the township o Saint-Remy. The foreground cypress dominates the magical night sky with its swirling clouds and yellow cresent moon and stars, while the small steeple in the background gives the scene depth. The intensely emotioinal fluid brushstrokes and rolling sky reveal a deeply troubled mind, yet do not convey despair.</p>

Van Gogh's chair is a modest timber chair, empty and forlorn, with only his tobacco and pipe, whereas Gauguin's chair is far more ornate and lavish. It may be that Van Gogh perceived himself as far less wordly and egotistical than Gauguin and more in keeping with the peasants he so often painted.</p>

One set depicts the flowers lying on the ground while another, the <em>Vase with Fifteen Sunflowers</em>, shows a bouquet of sunflowers in a vase. Created in Arles, France, the painting features thick brushstrokes (impasto) that evoke the texture of the seed-heads. Van Gogh intended to decorate Gaguin's room with these paintings in the Yellow House, which at the time he rented.</p>

He prepared the room himself with simple furniture and some of his work on the wall. The bright colors meant to express repose or sleep. Reasearch however shows that these contrasting colors are a result of discoloration over the years. The walls and doors were originally purpler rather than the blue we currently see. The odd angle of the rear wall wasn't a mistake on Van Gogh's part, as they really were skewed.</p>

This claim, however, is a persistent myth as he made several others works afterward. While he intended to have the wheatfields under the stormy skies to express sadness and extreme loneliness, Van Gogh also wanted to show what he consired healthy and fortifying about the countryside. He used powerful color combinations such as the blue sky that contrasts the yellow-orange wheat, and the red path that is intensified by the green bands of grass.</p>
